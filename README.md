# MoMath Hackathon 2017: Addition Addiction!

- Project category: Math Square behavior.
- Qiman Wang, Shantanu A. Patel.

## The Math

The current math concept is just addition. We can expand this to other operations too. The game is similar to Dance Dance Revolution.
Instead of steping on the correct arrows, our game requires stepping on the correct solution to a simple equation. EX: 2+2=?? , stepping on 4 would gain a +1 score.

## The Submission

Our submission is a simple game that will display a equation on the top and  display random numbers at random location (1 number is the  correct solution to the equation). The point of the game is to step on the right number(answer) and earn a score of +1. Our target audience is kids. We believe that this game can attract kids and encourage team work. There are many ways we can tailor this. One version of the game would be split kids into teams of about 6 players. The timer will last 60 seconds and the team with the highest score (highest right answer step) would win. This encourages teamwork, fast math thinking, some exercise( running to the numbers), and most importantly encourage kids to like solving equation and math!

## Additional Notes
There is one bug that we didn't have enough time to debug. The bug is that any step on the math square would be considered correct. We limited the pixel to be +- 30 pixels from the correct solution number, But there are other logical problems. If we have some more time, the bug will definitely be fixed.
